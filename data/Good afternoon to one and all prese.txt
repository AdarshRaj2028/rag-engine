Good afternoon to one and all present here, I am Adarsh Raj (and team intro). 
Today we are here for presenting our views about the topic "should IT engineers learn management skills before entering workforce". So getting started, 
the first question that lingers in our mind is what are management skills? It's not only that you have to communicate well with others, but it requires planning, leading and decision making along with communication. Now it overall helps professional to coordinate people, task and project effectively. In today's world, knowing only technical skills is not important enough. Management skills equally play important role.
